### Artificial Intelligence Content

Recent guidance by the Chicago Manual of Style regarding content from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are that these LLM technologies, colloquially known as "artificial intelligence" (AI), must be acknowledged if used as a source of information[<sup>2</sup>](#other-resources).

There are multiple scenarios with differing guidance for reference and citation format. Since this repository will display all AI-generated content for public reference, the following format will be used:

* **Publicly Available Artificial Intelligence Content**
    * **Reference Format**:
        * Claude, Anthropic, January 23, 2024, https://github.com/atet/cite.
    * **Citation Format**:
        * (Claude, January 23, 2024)

Plagiarism can consist of acts of commission (appropriating the words or ideas of another as one’s own), or omission (failing to acknowledge/document/credit the source or creator of words or ideas).

## 7. Quotes

<div id="chadwick-boseman-purpose-crosses-disciplines"></div>

> [![.img/quote.png](.img/quote.png)](#nolink) When you are deciding on next steps, next jobs, next careers, further education, you should find purpose rather than a job or a career. **Purpose crosses disciplines**. Purpose is an essential element of you. It is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time in history. Your very existence is wrapped up in the things you need to fulfill.

***How can I replicate the AI-generated responses seen here?*** | Commercial LLMs are stochastic, meaning they will produce inconsistent and seemingly random results every time they are used.
