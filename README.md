### References and Citations

This repository will use the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS)[<sup>1</sup>](#other-resources) Notes and Bibliography System (NB)[<sup>2</sup>](#other-resources).

As an example, a document or presentation (now refered to as a work) will utilize the CMOS NB system by marking citations with a superscript number (e.g., <sup>"123"</sup>) that corresponds to a note (i.e., a full citation) detailed in the footnotes or bottom of a work. Additionally a bibliography page or slide must conclude the work. 

The following are rules for **notes**:
* Numbering of the citation superscripts are consecutive throughout the work and does not restart on the next page or slide.
* Each piece of information that is referenced must have a corresponding footnote, even if the same source is referenced multiple times nonconsecutively in the same page or slide
* In the event of the same source being referenced multiple times in the same page or slide, the subsequent citation(s) could be shortened:
    * First note: `32. William A. Sahlman, “How to Write a Great Business Plan,” Harvard Business Review 75,July–August 1997, 103.`
    * Subsequent shortened note(s): `32. Sahlman, “Great Business Plan,” 103.`

The following are rules for the **bibliography**:
* Full notes are used with only a unique entry for each source
* Entries are arranged alphabetically regardless of the order referenced in the work
* Formatting:
    * The title "Bibliography" should be centered at the top of only the first page or slide of the bibliography section, followed by two blank lines before the first entry
    * Page or slide numbering must continue consecutively on the top right corner of the page or slide
    * If the title starts with a number, write the number as a word
    * Entries are single-spaced with one extra line between entries
    * Use hanging indents
    * Use the word "and" instead of the symbol "&"
    * For sources from the internet, use the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) instead of a URL if possible

**Journal Article**
* **Note Format**:
    * `<NOTE NUMBER>. <FIRST NAME> <LAST NAME>, "<TITLE OF ARTICLE>," <NAME OF JOURNAL> <VOLUME>, no. <ISSUE> (<MONTH/SEASON YEAR>): <PAGE RANGE>. <DOI or URL>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `1. Susan Satterfield, “Livy and the Pax Deum,” Classical Philology 111, no. 2 (April 2016): 170.`
* **Shortened Note Format**:
    * `<NOTE NUMBER>. <LAST NAME>, "<SHORTENED TITLE OF ARTICLE>," <PAGE RANGE>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `2. Satterfield, “Livy,” 172–73.`
* **Bibliography Format**:
    * `<LAST NAME> <FIRST NAME>, "<TITLE OF ARTICLE>," <NAME OF JOURNAL> <VOLUME>, no. <ISSUE> (<MONTH/SEASON YEAR>): <PAGE RANGE>. <DOI OR URL>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `Satterfield, Susan. “Livy and the Pax Deum.” Classical Philology 111, no. 2 (April 2016): 165–76.`
* **Caveat**: If there are more than four authors (typical of academic journals), use *et al.* only in the notes and the full author list in the bibliography
    * `3. Rachel A. Bay et al., ...`
    * `4. Bay et al., ...`

**Website Content (No Author)**
* **Note Format**:
    * `<NOTE NUMBER>. "<TITLE OF WORK>," <TITLE OF SECTION>, <COMPANY>, <DATE OF PUBLICATION, REVISION, OR ACCESS>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `1. “Privacy Policy,” Privacy & Terms, Google, last modified April 17, 2017, https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.`
* **Shortened Note Format**:
    * `<COMPANY>, "<TITLE OF WORK>."`
    * **Example**:
    * `2. Google, “Privacy Policy.”`
* **Bibliography Format**:
    * `<COMPANY>. "<TITLE OF WORK>," <TITLE OF SECTION>, <DATE OF PUBLICATION, REVISION, OR ACCESS>. <URL OR DOI>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `Google. “Privacy Policy.” Privacy & Terms. Last modified April 17, 2017. https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.`

### Artificial Intelligence Content

Recent guidance by the Chicago Manual of Style regarding content from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are that these LLM technologies, colloquially known as "artificial intelligence" (AI), must be acknowledged if used as a source of information[<sup>3</sup>](#other-resources).

There are multiple scenarios with differing guidance for reference and citation format. Since this repository will display all AI-generated content for public reference, the following format will be used:

**Publicly Available AI Content**
* **Note Format**:
    * `<NOTE NUMBER>. Text generated by <LLM>, <COMPANY>, <DATE OF ACCESS>, <URL>`
    * **Example**:
    * `1. Text generated by Claude, Anthropic, January 23, 2024, https://github.com/atet/cite/blob/main/.dat/business/20240123_Identifying_Additional_Business_Stakeholders_Beyond_the_Typical_Five.md`
* **Shortened Note Format†**:
    * `<LLM>, <DATE OF ACCESS>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `2. Claude, January 23, 2024`
* **Bibliography Format†**:
    * `<COMPANY>. Text generated by <LLM>, <DATE OF ACCESS>, <URL>.`
    * **Example**:
    * `Anthropic. Text generated by Claude, January 23, 2024, https://github.com/atet/cite/blob/main/.dat/business/20240123_Identifying_Additional_Business_Stakeholders_Beyond_the_Typical_Five.md`

†Specific guidance was not given by CMOS for shortened note or bibliography formats

<div id="chadwick-boseman-purpose-crosses-disciplines"></div>

> [![.img/quote.png](.img/quote.png)](#nolink) When you are deciding on next steps, next jobs, next careers, further education, you should find purpose rather than a job or a career. **Purpose crosses disciplines**. Purpose is an essential element of you. It is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time in history. Your very existence is wrapped up in the things you need to fulfill.

> [![.img/quote.png](.img/quote.png)](#nolink) So I think we can rethink the role of leaders at all levels. So we got to get over this idea of the leader as this all powerful CEO, it's not. In fact, great CEOs are much more into empowerment. So I think what we need to do is rethink leadership at all levels and teach people how to lead at all levels. **And then at an MBA level, how do I become a leader of leaders**, not managing leaders, not controlling managers. But how do I learn to become a leader of leaders?

***How can I replicate the AI-generated responses seen here?*** | Commercial LLMs are stochastic, meaning they will produce inconsistent and seemingly random results every time they are used.
